# Tiny Habits

### Question 1  
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The most interesting idea was that habits do not fail because of lack of motivation, but because they are too big. BJ Fogg explains that starting extremely small (like doing two push-ups after brushing teeth) makes habits easy to maintain and grow naturally over time.

### Question 2  
**How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?**

B = MAP means Behavior happens when Motivation, Ability, and Prompt come together.

- **M (Motivation):** The desire to do the behavior.  
- **A (Ability):** How easy the behavior is to do.  
- **P (Prompt):** The trigger that reminds you to act.  

To make new habits easier, focus on increasing ability (make the habit very small) and use a clear prompt. Instead of waiting for motivation, reduce the difficulty of the habit.

### Question 3  
**Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?**

Celebration creates positive emotions, and emotions wire habits into the brain. When you celebrate immediately after completing a habit, your brain associates the behavior with success and satisfaction. This makes the habit stick faster and become automatic.

### Question 4  
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The most interesting idea was that small improvements done consistently lead to massive long-term results. Improving just 1% every day may seem small, but over time it creates exponential growth and significant transformation.

### Question 5  
**What is the book's perspective about Identity?**

The book explains that real change comes from identity change. Instead of focusing on goals, we should focus on becoming the type of person who performs certain habits. For example, instead of saying “I want to run,” say “I am a runner.”

### Question 6  
**What is the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?**

To make a habit easier:
- Make it obvious  
- Make it attractive  
- Make it easy  
- Make it satisfying  

Reduce friction, start small, prepare the environment in advance, and follow the two-minute rule (start with a version that takes less than two minutes).

### Question 7  
**What is the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?**

To make a bad habit harder:
- Make it invisible  
- Make it unattractive  
- Make it difficult  
- Make it unsatisfying  

Remove triggers, increase friction, limit access, and create consequences for doing the habit.

### Question 8  
Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and/or response satisfying?

**One habit I want to do more of: Daily Coding Practice**

Steps to make it easier:
- Keep my laptop ready on my desk (make cue obvious).
- Schedule coding at the same time every day.
- Start with just 20 minutes (make it easy).
- Track streaks on GitHub or a habit tracker.
- Reward myself after completion (small celebration or checkmark).

### Question 9  
Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

**One habit I want to reduce: Excessive Social Media Scrolling**

Steps to reduce it:
- Remove social media apps from home screen (make cue invisible).
- Turn off notifications.
- Set app time limits.
- Keep the phone away while studying.
- Replace scrolling time with reading or coding practice.
